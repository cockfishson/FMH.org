          With thousands of players in Football Manager 2023, finding the right talent for your team can be a daunting task. However, by utilizing the advanced player search filters, you can streamline your scouting process and identify the perfect fit for your squad. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you become a player search filter pro:
          <br><span> 1.Familiarize Yourself with Filter Categories</span>
          FM23‘s player search filters are divided into several categories, including:
          
          <br>General information: age, nationality, club, etc.
          <br>Position and role: specific positions and player roles
          <br>Attributes: technical, mental, and physical attributes
          <br>Contract: contract status, wages, and release clauses
          <br>Understand these categories to effectively narrow down your search.
          
          <br>2. Define Your Scouting Criteria
          Before diving into the search filters, establish clear scouting criteria for your team. Consider factors such as your club’s financial resources, the positions you need to strengthen, and the type of players who fit your tactical system.

          3. Use a Combination of Filters
          Combine multiple filters to refine your search and find players who meet your specific requirements. For example, if you’re looking for a speedy winger, filter by position (winger), pace (15+), and dribbling (15+).
          <br>
          4. Be Flexible with Your Requirements
          While it’s essential to have clear scouting criteria, remaining flexible can lead to discovering hidden gems. Try adjusting your filters to explore players who might not fit your initial criteria but could still be valuable additions to your squad.
          <br>
          5. Save and Load Custom Filter Presets
          Save time by creating custom filter presets for different types of players. This feature allows you to quickly switch between different scouting criteria without having to manually adjust each filter.</p>
